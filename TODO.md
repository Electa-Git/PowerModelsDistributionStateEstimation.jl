## A list of random ideas and/or things to do before v0.2.0

- unify conversion type MultiplicationFraction and Fraction? maybe with create_conversion_constraint(pm::_PMs.ACP, original_var, msr::SquareFraction; nw=nw, nph=3) + create_conversion_constraint(pm::_PMs.ACR, original_var, msr::SquareFraction; nw=nw, nph=3)

- model loads as constant power? worked in previous version of DSSE (before PMD 0.9.0 introduced complexity)

- change ipopt settings/add derivatives?

- are there just too many measurements?

-test on VM so we can use MA27

-add measurements at transformer level?

-changing ipopt tol doesn't help make things faster for se

- break into multi-area

- add variable bounds?

- explore smiplified formulations of components?

- I tried removing the transfo from EU LV feeder,but didn't help the tragically slow calculations/convergence issues. perhaps more diverse weights?

-find a way to use sdp where there are transfos

## TODO

[ ] check out the NLsolve implementation in PowerModels and use it for a set of grids in order to have a sense of its speed?
[ ] https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl/blob/master/src/prob/pf.jl line 529
[ ] if you could separate built and solve time that would be great no pressure if you canâ€™t get it done!   line 654
[ ] maybe include a comparison between ipopt and nlsolve
[ ] https://lanl-ansi.github.io/PowerModels.jl/dev/power-flow/
[ ] if it outperforms Ipopt we might want to write a WLS and use NLSolve as solver for this subclass.
