## A list of things to do before v0.2.0

- [ ] update code for PMD v0.10.0

- [ ] relaxations of measurement conversions

- [ ] individual SE criterion per measurement ("mixed" criterion)

- [ ] add rho max speed up comp time (if infeasible, bad data identification possible?)

- [ ] quantify rescaler

- [ ] investigate techniques to speed up code

- [ ] automated non gaussian measurement creation

- [ ] add some tests on post/pre processing functionalities to make sure they don't break

- [x] code beta distribution with 4 parameters

- [x] increase code coverage for distributions

## TODO before 0.X

- [ ] add loads and transformer models (v0.3?)?
