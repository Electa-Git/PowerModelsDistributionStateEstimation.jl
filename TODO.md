## A list of things to do before v0.2.0

- [ ] update code for PMD v0.10.0 (!!!)
      - rename constraints accordingly
      - iteration through conductors in all functionalities
      - deprecate "gmm" for "ga"

- [x] individual SE criterion per measurement ("mixed" criterion) (!!!)

- [x] add rho max speed up comp time (if infeasible, bad data identification possible?) (!!!)

- [x] automated non gaussian measurement creation (!!!)

- [ ] quantify rescaler for non-gaussian

- [ ] investigate techniques to speed up code (continuous effort)

- [ ] input through array of measurements rather then csv

- [x] code beta distribution with 4 parameters

- [x] increase code coverage for distributions

- [] consider deprecating reduced_ac and reduced_ivr after test against @smart_constraint (especially reduced_ac)

- [] add test for rand(ExtendedBeta) (!!!)

## TODO before 0.X

- [ ] add loads and transformer models (v0.3?)?
