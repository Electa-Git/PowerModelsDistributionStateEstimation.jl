# function constraint_mc_residual(pm::_PMs.AbstractPowerModel, i::Int)
#
# # Design-choice: split the residuals in their respective parts, i.e., p, q and
# # vm. This introduces a significant number of extra variables and constraints
# # which might not be necessary, as they will equal zero and which are not
# # elimated as Ipopt does not have a presolve. It might be better from a
# # computational perspective to do this using a single variable res. Anyway k-bye
# # This constraint is for the absolute basecase, i.e., it does not containt the
# # variables for storage and transformers.
