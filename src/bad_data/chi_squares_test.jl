    exceeds_chi_squares_threshold(sol_dict::Dict, data::Dict; prob_false::Float64=0.05)

Standard bad data detection method that consists of performing a Chi squares analysis on the objective value, i.e.,
the sum of the residuals. The outcome of the analysis depends on the degrees of freedom of the problem, which are calculated calling
the `get_degrees_of_freedom` function (see below).

This function returns a Boolean. If `true`, there are probably bad data points, if `false` there probably are not.

Arguments:
- `sol_dict`: solution dictionary, i.e., the default output dictionary of state estimation calculations,
- `data`: data input of the state estimation calculations, used to calculate the degrees of freedom,
- `prob_false`: probability of errors allowed in the Chi squares test.

"""
    get_degrees_of_freedom(data::Dict)
Calculates the degrees of freedom of the state estimation problem.
These equal `m-n` where `m` is the number of measurements and `n` that of the variables.
In general, the system is fully described by the voltage variables of all its buses.
Each bus has two variables for each terminal: voltage angle and magnitude in polar form, real and imag part in rectangular form.
Thus, a three-phase bus has 6 variables, a single-phase bus has 2.
An exception to this are reference buses, i.e., those buses that have a fixed voltage angle that serves as a reference. It is assumed
that there is only one reference bus in the network, and therefore its 3 (if three-phase) or 1 (if single-phase) angle variables are removed
from the count of `n`.
Furthermore, since zero-injection buses are taken care of by equality constraints, these do not count as variables, and thus are not
included in the calculation of `n`, either. Zero-injection buses are defined as buses that have no loads or generators connected to it.
`m` is simply the sum of the measurements in `data["meas"]` where again, if a measurement refers to three phases `m+=3` else `m+=1`.
