PowerModelsDSSE.jl is an extention package of PowerModelsDistribution.jl for
Static Distribution System State Estimation. A Distribution System State
Estimator determines the *most-likely* state of distribution system given a set
of uncertainties, e.g., measurement errors, pseudo-measurements, etc. These
uncertainties may pertain to any quantity of any network component, e.g., :vm
of a :bus, :pd of a :load, etc.

Currently, uncertainties may either be described by:
- a deterministic value {Float64}, or
- a continuous univariate distribution {ContinuousUnivariateDistribution}:
    * a normal distribution, modeled through either WLS or LAV approach, or
    * a non-normal distribution, modeled through -logpdf.

## Core Problem Specification

- State Estimation (SE) as equality constrained optimization problem

## Core Network Constraint Formulations

- AC Polar (exact)
- AC Rectangular (exact)
- AC IV Rectangular (exact)
- SDP (positive semi-definite relaxation)

All the formulations are three-phase unbalanced and feature accurate delta/wye load models.
The exact formulations also feature delta/wye transformer models.
Network constraint, load and transformer models are taken from PowerModelsDistribution.jl

## TODO

- check out the NLsolve implementation in PowerModels and use it for a set of grids in order to have a sense of its speed?
- https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl/blob/master/src/prob/pf.jl line 529
- if you could separate built and solve time that would be great no pressure if you canâ€™t get it done!   line 654
- maybe include a comparison between ipopt and nlsolve
- https://lanl-ansi.github.io/PowerModels.jl/dev/power-flow/
- if it outperforms Ipopt we might want to write a WLS and use NLSolve as solver for this subclass.
