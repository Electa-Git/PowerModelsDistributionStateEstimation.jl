# Mathematical Model of the State Estimation Criteria

Let `X` be the random variable associated to a measurement `m ‚àà ùìú` and `x ‚àà ùìß`
the related variable, where:
* `ùìú` denotes the set of measurements,
* `ùìß` denotes the (extended) variable space of the OPF problem.

The state of a power system can be determined based on a specific estimation
criterion. The state estimator criteria can be classified into two groups based
on the random variable `X`:
- `Gaussian`
    * `wlav`: weighted least absolute value (exact)
    * `rwlav`: relaxed weighted least absolute value (exact relaxation)
    * `wls`: weighted least square (exact)
    * `rwls`: relaxed weighted least square (exact relaxation)
- `Non-Gaussian`
    * `mle`: maximum likelihood estimation (exact)
    * `ga`: Gaussian approximation (inexact)

The user has to specify the `criterion` for each measurement individually.
However, if all measurements can be described by the same criterion, it is sufficient to
set the criterion name in the `se_settings` ([Input Data Format](@ref)), as PMDSE
will automatically call assign_unique_individual_criterion!().
```@docs
assign_unique_individual_criterion!(data::Dict)
```
To use a combination of different criteria, the user should provide information
in `data["meas"]`, under a `crit` key. For example:
`data["meas"]["1"]["crit"] = "rwlav"` and `data["meas"]["2"]["crit"] = "mle"`.
A basic helper function to assign different criteria to different measurement is provided:
```@docs
assign_basic_individual_criteria!(data::Dict; chosen_criterion::String="rwlav")
```

Furthermore, a rescaler can be introduced to improve the convergence of the state
estimation. The user has to specify the `rescaler` through the `se_settings` ([Input Data Format](@ref)).
If no rescaler is specified, it will default to `1.0`.

## Gaussian State Estimation Criteria

### WLAV and rWLAV

The WLAV criterion represents the absolute value norm (p=1) and is given by
```math
\begin{eqnarray}
      \rho_{m}          &= \frac{| x - \mu_{m} |}{\text{rsc} \cdot \sigma_{m}},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m \to x \in \mathcal{X},
\end{eqnarray}
```
where:
* `œÅ` denotes the residual associated with a measurement $m$,
* `x` denotes the variable corresponding to a measurement $m$.
* `Œº` denotes the measured value, i.e., expectation `ùêÑ(X)`,
* `œÉ` denotes the the measurement error, i.e., standard deviation `‚àö(ùêï(X))`,
* `rsc` denotes the rescaler.

Solving a state estimation using the WLAV criterion is non-trivial as the
absolute value function is not continuously differentiable. This drawback is
lifted by its exact linear relaxation: rWLAV[^1]. The rWLAV criterion is given by

```math
\begin{eqnarray}
      \rho_{m}          &\geq \frac{ x_{m} - \mu_{m} }{\text{rsc} \cdot \sigma_{m}},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m \to x_{m} \in \mathcal{X},    \\
      \rho_{m}          &\geq - \frac{ x_{m} - \mu_{m} }{\text{rsc} \cdot \sigma_{m}},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m \to x_{m} \in \mathcal{X},    \\
\end{eqnarray}
```

[^1]: Note that this relaxation is only exact in the context of minimization problem.

## WLS and rWLS

The WLS criterion represents the Eucledian norm (p=2) and is given by
```math
\begin{eqnarray}
      \rho_{m}          &= \frac{( x_{m} - \mu_{m} )^{2}}{\text{rsc} \cdot \sigma_{m}^{2}},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m_{m} \to x \in \mathcal{X}.
\end{eqnarray}
```
The rWLS criterion relaxes the former as a cone and is given by
```math
\begin{eqnarray}
      rsc \cdot \sigma_{m}^{2} \cdot \rho_{m} &\geq ( x_{m} - \mu_{m} )^{2},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m \to x_{m} \in \mathcal{X}.
\end{eqnarray}
```

## Non-Gaussian State Estimation Criteria

## Gaussian Mixture Estimation

The Gaussian mixture criterion splits the random variable `X` into `ùìù` Gaussian
components `Y`, and introduces two constraints. First, the related variable `x`
is the weighted sum of the variables `y` related to the Gaussian components. Second, the
overall residual `œÅ` equal to the sum of Gaussian components' residuals. The
`rwlav` criterion is choosen to model the residual of the Gaussian components.

```math
\begin{eqnarray}
      x_{m}             &= \sum_{m \to n \in \mathcal{N}} w_{n} y_{n},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m \to x_{m} \in \mathcal{X}                                  \\
      \rho_{m}          &\geq \sum_{m \to n \in \mathcal{N}} \frac{ y_{n} - \mu_{n} }{\text{rsc} \cdot w_{n} \sigma_{n}},\quad m \in \mathcal{M},     \\
      \rho_{m}          &\geq - \sum_{m \to n \in \mathcal{N}} \frac{ y_{n} - \mu_{n} }{\text{rsc} \cdot w_{n} \sigma_{m}},\quad m \in \mathcal{M},   \\
\end{eqnarray}
```
where:
* `w` denotes the weight associated with a Gaussian component.

The user has to specify the `number_of_gaussian` through the `se_settings` ([Input Data Format](@ref)).
If no number is specified, it will default to `10`.

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The maximum likelihood criterion links the measurement residual to the logpdf of
the associated distribution and is given by
```math
\begin{eqnarray}
      \rho_{m}          &= - \text{rsc} \cdot \text{logpdf}_{m}(x) + \text{shf},\quad m \in \mathcal{M}: m \to x \in \mathcal{X}.
\end{eqnarray}
```
where `shf` denotes a shift setting the minimum value of the residual to zero.

To avoid the use of automatic differentiation, the first derivative (`gradlogpdf`)
is provided by Distributions.jl and the second derivative (`heslogpdf`) is provided internally.
