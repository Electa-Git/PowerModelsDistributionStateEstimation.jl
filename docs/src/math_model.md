# The PowerModelsDSSE Mathematical Model

This section describes the basic mathematical model of the standard state estimation problem as implemented in src/prob/se.jl. Mathematical optimization problems are made of variables, constraints and an objective. The equations provided in this section refer specifically to state estimation as performed with the (exact) AC polar formulation. The user is referred to the implementation to see how this changes with the other formulations. The best reference for precise mathematical formulations is anyway the implementation itself.
